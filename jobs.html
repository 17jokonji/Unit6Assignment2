      <h2>Front end Web designer needed</h2>
      <p>A front-end web developer is a skilled professional responsible for creating the visual elements and user experience of a website. Front-end developers use a combination of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, layout, and design of a website. They collaborate with designers, back-end developers, and other team members to ensure that the website is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

One of the key roles of a front-end web developer is to ensure that a website is responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes. This involves implementing responsive design techniques, testing the website on different devices, and making adjustments to ensure a seamless user experience across platforms. Front-end developers also focus on optimizing website performance by reducing loading times, improving site speed, and enhancing overall user engagement through interactive features and animations.

In addition to technical skills, front-end developers often possess strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a creative eye for design. They must be able to translate the vision of web designers into functional and visually appealing websites while also adhering to best practices and industry standards. Front-end developers play a crucial role in bringing a website to life, shaping its overall look and feel, and creating an engaging online experience for users.</p>

      <h2>Back end web designer needed </h2>
      <p>A backend web developer is a crucial player in the world of web development, responsible for the behind-the-scenes functionality of websites and web applications. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, or Ruby, backend developers work on server-side development, database management, and ensuring the smooth operation of a website's core functionality. Their expertise lies in creating the logic and algorithms that power a website, handling data processing, authentication, security, and server management.

One of the key responsibilities of a backend web developer is to build and maintain the infrastructure that supports a website's functionality. This includes setting up databases, writing server-side scripts, and creating APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect the frontend and backend components of a website. Backend developers work closely with frontend developers, designers, and project managers to ensure that the website functions seamlessly and delivers a great user experience. Their work often involves troubleshooting technical issues, optimizing website performance, and implementing security measures to protect sensitive data.

In addition to technical skills, backend web developers also need to have strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of web development best practices. They must stay up-to-date on emerging technologies and trends in backend development to continuously enhance their skills and adapt to evolving industry standards. With their expertise in crafting the backbone of a website, backend developers play a vital role in ensuring that websites run smoothly, securely, and efficiently</p>
